# Add support path to help text

Per clig.dev: 'Provide a support path for feedback and issues'

Add GitHub issues link to help output. Users should easily find where to report bugs or request features.

Implementation:
- Add to main help text: 'Report issues: https://github.com/crcatala/raindrop-cli-spike/issues'
- Consider adding to error messages for unexpected errors
- Could also link to docs when we have them
