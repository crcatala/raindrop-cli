# Add collections subcommand

Add a `collections` subcommand for managing Raindrop.io collections.

## Proposed Commands

```bash
rdcli collections list              # List all collections (hierarchical)
rdcli collections show <id>         # Show collection details + stats
rdcli collections create <name>     # Create new collection
rdcli collections delete <id>       # Delete collection
rdcli collections stats             # Show system collection stats (all/unsorted/trash counts)
```

## API Support (via raindrop-client)

The client exposes these methods:
- `collection.getRootCollections()` - Get top-level collections
- `collection.getChildCollections()` - Get nested collections
- `collection.getCollection(id)` - Get single collection
- `collection.createCollection()` - Create collection
- `collection.removeCollection(id)` - Delete collection
- `collection.getSystemCollectionStats()` - Stats for all/unsorted/trash
- `collection.updateCollection(id, data)` - Update collection

## Output Considerations

### List command
- Show hierarchical structure (indented tree)
- Include: ID, name, count, parent info
- Support `--flat` flag for non-nested output

### Stats command
```
All Bookmarks: 1,234
Unsorted: 56
Trash: 12
```

## Priority Rationale

P1 because collections are fundamental to Raindrop organization. Users need to:
- Discover collection IDs for `bookmarks list <collection-id>`
- Manage their organizational structure
