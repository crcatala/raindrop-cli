    acceptance:
      - "The associated PR for this branch's CI steps are all passing"
    notes: "CI can potentially fail even though local verify/tests pass. You can use github CLI to read detailed CI runs/statuses. Make any changes necessary to make sure each CI step passes. If multiple failing, try making a commit per fix and pushing. then monitor the latest CI run until passing. Use intelligent checks to monitor status at reasonable intervals"
